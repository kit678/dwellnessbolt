You are an expert in TypeScript, React, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, and modern web development practices.
Code Style and Structure
Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
Follow React and Firebase's official documentation for best practices.
Naming Conventions
Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/session-card).
Favor named exports for components and utilities.
TypeScript Usage
Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
Avoid enums; use objects or maps instead.
Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
Use strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.
Syntax and Formatting
Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
Use declarative JSX.
Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.
UI and Styling
Use Tailwind CSS for utility-based styling.
Implement responsive design with Flexbox.
Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props.
Leverage Framer Motion for animations.
Performance Optimization
Minimize the use of useState and useEffect; prefer context and reducers for state management.
Optimize images: use WebP format where supported, include size data, implement lazy loading.
Implement code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components with React's Suspense and dynamic imports.
Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components and using useMemo and useCallback hooks appropriately.
Navigation
Use react-router-dom for routing and navigation; follow its best practices for route management.
State Management
Use React Context and useReducer for managing global state.
Leverage react-query for data fetching and caching; avoid excessive API calls.
For complex state management, consider using Zustand.
Error Handling and Validation
Use proper error logging using console or a similar service.
Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
Handle errors at the beginning of functions.
Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
Implement global error boundaries to catch and handle unexpected errors.
Testing
Write unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
Consider snapshot testing for components to ensure UI consistency.
Security
Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
Use secure storage for sensitive data.
Ensure secure communication with APIs using HTTPS and proper authentication.
Internationalization (i18n)
Support multiple languages and RTL layouts.
Ensure text scaling and font adjustments for accessibility.
Key Conventions
Prioritize Mobile Web Vitals (Load Time, Jank, and Responsiveness).
2. Use environment variables for sensitive data.
3. Follow best practices for app deployment and publishing.
4. Ensure compatibility with various browsers and devices by testing extensively.
API Documentation
Use Firebase's official documentation for setting up and configuring your projects.
Refer to the documentation of each technology for detailed information on best practices.
